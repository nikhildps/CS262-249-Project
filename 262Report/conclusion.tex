This work was a stepping stone towards a fully distributed implementation of the Global Data Plane. We began with an existing prototype that handles log storage at a single server and integrated it with the Chimera routing library. We then started working towards optimizing this system by analyzing Chimera's shortcomings. Our principal goal was to create a hybrid system that incorporates both a P2P overlay network and the underlying physical network. Since the GDP is intended to support swarm applications, we used sMAP, a successfully deployed sensor network platform, as the basis for our design and testing. We evaluated our system using geographically distributed servers deployed on Amazon's EC2 platform and simulated sMAP sensor clients. Our results demonstrated that our efforts to create a hybrid routing system are worthwhile, but work remains to be done in order to develop a more efficient and stable system.
