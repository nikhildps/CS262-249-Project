We created a routing infrastructure combining a peer-to-peer overlay network with the underlying physical network in order to support a distributed prototype of the Global Data Plane. This architecture improves upon an existing baseline key-based peer-to-peer routing algorithm. sMAP served as a representative swarm application and motivating use case. Our attempts to use optimizations incorporating the physical network into our system met with mixed results in terms of latency, with only \textit{Direct Source Routing} achieving a clear improvement.
